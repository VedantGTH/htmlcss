    <p><b>Lions (Panthera leo) are large, social carnivores known as the "king of the jungle." Native to sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in India, they live in groups called prides. Male lions are known for their distinctive manes, while females do most of the hunting. Lions hunt large herbivores like zebras and buffaloes, using teamwork to catch prey. They communicate through vocalizations, including their iconic roar, which can be heard miles away. Lions give birth to 1-4 cubs after a 110-day gestation period. They are currently listed as "Vulnerable" due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, with fewer than 20,000 lions left in the wild.</b></p>

    <p><b>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest wild cats, known for their striking orange coats with black stripes. They are solitary, carnivorous predators that primarily hunt large prey like deer and wild boar. Tigers are found in various habitats across Asia, with several subspecies, including Bengal, Siberian, and Sumatran tigers. They are strong swimmers and have a unique territorial behavior. Tigers are endangered, with only around 3,900 remaining in the wild, primarily due to habitat loss and poaching. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats and curbing illegal hunting.</b></p>
